# Real-time Point Cloud Generation using Lidar and collision avoidance
This is a Lidar simulator created in Unity3D, its purpose is to generate lidar data virtually, without the need of a real Lidar sensor and in real-time. A car equipped with the sensor is given a fixed path with obstacles to demonstrate collision avoidance.
